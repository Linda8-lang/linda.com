        <h2>Breaking from Shackles of Fear</h2>
        <p>
          After realizing that, I have lived through three decades with nothing
          to show; I am stupefied. My mind works day and night; making
          questionably decisions because of the fear of unknown, maybe I am
          paranoid. Precisely, I cannot trust my risk taking strategy anymore. I
          doubt every step I take, presuming they are missteps taking me far and
          farther away from my dream. I shall overcome, I shall stand tall, but
          holding on is out of question. Perhaps, I should risk and fail; the
          good news is I will be some steps ahead rather than staying put for I
          cannot know what lie on the other end. I will risk until there is no
          risk to take anymore. The more daring the risk is the more alive I
          will feel, the more life will be worth the grind. False optimism could
          be my pace moderator though not my all time tools for progression.
          More often than not, I will ignore it and make rushed decisions, yearn
          for hurried outcomes. I must take the meticulous actions now because
          delaying them until everything is fine might be a futile wait. Time is
          not on my side. I must act. I must ignore the dreadful feeling. I must
          break from the shackles of fear and act.
